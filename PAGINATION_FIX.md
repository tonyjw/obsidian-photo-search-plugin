PAGINATION LOADING STATE FIX
============================

## Problem Identified
When users clicked the "Next" button in pagination, the loading spinner would appear correctly, but after the new page loaded, the pagination info would remain stuck showing "Loading..." instead of updating to show the correct page number (e.g., "Page 2 of 5").

## Root Cause
The issue was in the `loadPage()` method where the loading state (`this.loadingPage[provider] = false`) was being cleared in the `finally` block AFTER the `renderPhotosGrid()` method had already been called. Since `addPaginationControls()` checks the loading state to determine what to display, it was still seeing `loadingPage[provider] = true` and showing the loading spinner instead of the page info.

## Solution Implemented
Modified the `loadPage()` method to:

1. **Clear loading state BEFORE re-rendering**: Move `this.loadingPage[provider] = false` to happen immediately after successful data loading and before calling `renderPhotosGrid()`

2. **Improved error handling**: On error, clear the loading state and revert the page number to the previous valid page

3. **Removed finally block**: No longer needed since loading state is now handled explicitly in both success and error cases

## Code Changes

### Before:
```typescript
// Update data...
// Re-render grid...
} catch (error) {
  // Handle error...
} finally {
  this.loadingPage[provider] = false; // ❌ Too late!
}
```

### After:
```typescript
// Update data...
this.loadingPage[provider] = false; // ✅ Clear before re-render
// Re-render grid...
} catch (error) {
  // Handle error...
  this.loadingPage[provider] = false; // ✅ Also clear on error
  // Revert page number on error
}
```

## Expected Behavior Now
1. **Click Next**: Loading spinner appears with "Loading page X..."
2. **Data loads**: Loading state cleared immediately
3. **Re-render**: `addPaginationControls()` sees `loadingPage[provider] = false`
4. **Display**: Shows correct "Page X of Y" instead of loading spinner
5. **Buttons**: Previous/Next buttons are properly enabled/disabled based on current page

## Error Handling Improvements
- Loading state cleared on both success and error
- Page number reverted to previous valid page on error
- User gets proper error notification via Notice
- Prevents getting stuck in loading state

**STATUS: ✅ FIXED**

The pagination controls should now properly update to show the correct page number after navigation instead of remaining stuck in the loading state.
